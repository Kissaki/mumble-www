We provide downloads for the official client and server programs. A Linux distribution may provide their own packages and have their own maintainer, which we will describe below. We also link to some third party projects.

Version 1.3.2 is the latest stable version of Mumble and was released on July 08, 2020.

Note (macOS): Apple introduced a stricter verification and warning process. macOS will now warn you when installing the Mumble application. This is expected and not a security issue. Apple will not currently verify and acknowledge our package unless we pay a significant amount of money. *(Issue tracked in {{< issue 4263 >}})*

Server note: *Depending on the context and packager our server program is called “mumble-server” or “Murmur”*

## Development snapshots

[Development snapshots](https://dl.mumble.info/) contain unreleased features and changes that will eventually be available in the next stable release. Please report any problems you encounter on [our issue tracker](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues).

When a new feature release is published the snapshots will naturally transform into them. If you want to keep using snapshots after the next feature release, you will have to manually upgrade to one again.
