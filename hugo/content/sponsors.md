Our infrastructure is made possible thanks to the help of the sponsors that supported us over the years by providing their services for free.

## Fastly

Thanks to [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com)'s CDN, only ~5% of the traffic hits our servers. The rest of the traffic is served by their insanely fast network.

This service provides us quite a few important advantages, such as:

* Caching. This allowed our websites to be reachable during server(s) maintenance.
* High speed. Very important, especially for our download server.
* Lower bandwidth costs (our servers are not sponsored).
* IPv6 support, even for IPv4-only backends.
* DDoS protection.

Also, we haven't experienced a single downtime in many years.

## MacStadium

Thanks to [MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com) we can maintain support for macOS, as they provide us access to a 2012 Mac Mini.

Before that, the only member of our team who owns a Mac used to do all the macOS-related work, until he unfortunately had no time to dedicate to the project anymore.

We're very happy with the service so far. *Slightly* less happy with macOS, but that's another story (and unrelated to the service itself).
